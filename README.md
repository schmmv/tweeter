# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone that uses jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and JS. This project was for practicing front-end skills using these technologies as part of the Lighthouse Labs (LHL) Web Development bootcamp. 

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
5. Start Tweeting!
